## Dependency

MATLAB 5.0+ is additionally required.

## Data

1. `air_original` is the original data downloaded from the website listed in the draft.

2. `air.csv` (or `realcase_air.mat`) is the  transformed data at which each row represents locations.

3. `airdata` contains the selected 30 locations.

4. `spatial_domain` contains coordinates used in simulation.


## Code 

`error_metric_for_simulation` and `error_real_case` are MATLAB file for simulation and real case study.
